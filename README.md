# A GUI based  graphical visualisation of basic sorting algorithms

#### It is a graphical way of visualizing the working of a sorting algorithm.
#### Different colours is used to justify the process and speed scale for better visualization.

The common algorithms used are-
* Bubble sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort

The common features are-
1. Speed scale--used to adjust the processing speed
1. Min-Max scale--used to set the minimum and maximum value of the array
1. Data scale--used to set the data size

#### After downloading the files run the sort_algo.py file.
